I tried closing my eyes to at least try to sleep. I tried to 
feel the tiredness of my body, to perhaps coax my mind into 
feeling the same. When it didn't work I opened my eyes again. 
At the border of my vision I could sense something dark; 
a deathly black shadow. I went to turn my head and realized 
I couldn't move one bit. Paralysis struck my neck as if I had 
been bitten by a rattlesnake.

"Who's out there?" I whispered. Though I knew not why, I felt 
a prescence. The weakness in my body was quickly giving way to 
writhing fear.
